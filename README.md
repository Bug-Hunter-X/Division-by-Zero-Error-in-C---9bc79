# Division by Zero Bug in C++

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in C++: division by zero. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.

The bug occurs because the program attempts to divide an integer (10) by zero, which is mathematically undefined and leads to a program crash or unexpected behavior. The solution involves adding error handling to prevent division by zero.
